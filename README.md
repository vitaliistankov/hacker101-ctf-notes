# hacker101-ctf-notes

Organized CTF notes for Hacker101 challenges.

## Structure
- `Challenge-Name/NOTES.md` — detailed notes for each challenge
- `Challenge-Name/artifacts/` — screenshots, downloaded files, scripts
- `templates/NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` — template to use for new challenge notes

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. For each solved challenge, create a folder `Challenge-Name/`.
3. Copy `templates/NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` to `Challenge-Name/NOTES.md` and fill it.
4. Commit artifacts (screenshots, payloads) into `Challenge-Name/artifacts/`.

## Tips
- Keep flags in `NOTES.md` only if you are comfortable storing them locally.
- Use descriptive commit messages, e.g. "Add Micro-CMS-v1 writeup".
- Consider adding `SUMMARY.md` for quick index of solved challenges.
